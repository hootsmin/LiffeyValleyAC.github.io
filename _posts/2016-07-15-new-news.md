Peter Arthur continued his fine track form when winning  theâ€¨
Dublin Senior 5000 Metres at this week's Graded Meeting
at Irishtown Stadium.

Peter also recorded a new Personal Best over the distance
with a finishing time of 15mins 5 seconds.After an opening lap
of 73 secs a small group of six athletes including Peter went clear
of the field and they passed 3000 Metres in 9 mins 10 secs.

Peter was now in a group of three who were making the pace.
With three laps to go he took control and immediately opened
a gap on his two pursuers which he stretched as he went for the
finish line. A last 200 metres of 33 seconds showed his superior
speed and strength  was the  winning factor.

This is Peters second senior title win this year as he also won the Leinster
Senior Cross Country title in January.
